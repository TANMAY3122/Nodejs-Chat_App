# Nodejs-Chat_App

Build a realtime chat app with NodeJS, ReactJS, and ChatEngine.io Here, we are going to build a full-stack, realtime chat app with Node JS, React JS and ChatEngine.io.

This feature rich application will have: User authentication, socket connections, real-time messaging, image and file attachments, group chats and DMs, read receipts… and more!

For our backend, we’ll use NodeJS and express. We’ll also store all our chat data on ChatEngine.io which has APIs and Socket channels for hosting chats.

For our frontend, we’ll be using ReactJS with some pre-built Chat UI components. Chat Engine’s NPM components are free building blocks for Chat UIs.

We’ll be building an app like in the demo above. With that in mind, let’s get started!
